This is a highly WIP, do not try this at home

## Next steps
- [ ] Make lists work (harder than it looks!)
- [ ] Add support for links
- At this point support for Layer 1 should be complete (and even more than complete)
- [ ] Add edit functionality (for now, just raw text editing)
- [ ] Add quick buttons
  - [ ] Edit document
  - [ ] Toggle folding (open all/close all)
  - [ ] Reload file
- [ ] Improve style for headers and other components
- [ ] Find a way to build it correctly for Windows and Linux
- [ ] Test the android build
- [ ] Make it work on android
- *First useful MVP*, now the real work starts
- [ ] Allow it to get a directory and use it as a workspace (open directory feature)
- [ ] Create (or use norg-dirman) a workspace management system
- [ ] Create an "options" page to setup workspaces
- [ ] Make links work within a workspace (broader support for links)
- *The workspace update is ready*
- [ ] Add the verbatim ranged tags
- [ ] check if the strong delimiting modifier works (not sure it does, but probably it works already)
- *Layer 2 complete*
- [ ] Add the detached modifier extensions (mostly todos)
- We'll see what's next.
